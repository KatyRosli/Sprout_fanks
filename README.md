## Contribution:

Idea & Design:
I pitch 80% of the idea (self care web app). I mock up wireframes and design both UX & UI interface.
I also created a branding workshop with the team. Both logo and all of the illustrations are own by me, as I created them from scratch. 

Code:
Home not logged in - everyone coded as a mob.
Home logged in - everyone coded as a mob.
